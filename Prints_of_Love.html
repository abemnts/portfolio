        <h1>Prints of Love Growth Investment Exploration</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Context:</h2>
            <p>During a technical product management course, our team of 4 evaluated a firm’s financials and dissected best practices in product management. The firm, Prints of Love (PoL), is an e-commerce platform (<a href="https://www.printsoflove.com">www.printsoflove.com</a>) where U.S. consumers—and occasionally designers or planners—upload images of event materials (e.g., wedding invitations), customize them, and request rapid printing and delivery. PoL’s standout business model relies on organic customer acquisition: instead of investing in outbound marketing, PoL partners with digital designers (primarily from Etsy) who sell digital prints and refer orders to PoL in exchange for a fee, so PoL does not pay for any outbound marketing to acquire its customers.</p>
<p>I functioned as a Product Manager to spearhead research into PoL’s next growth opportunity by calculating ROI and assessing overall benefit to the firm. Collaborating within a four-person team—comprising roles of product managers, UX researchers, and financial planning analysts—we focused on identifying new avenues aligned with PoL’s growth strategy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Firm's Goal:</h2>
            <p>Better Monetize customers both at or post-transaction time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Strategy Alignment:</h2>
            <p>Specifically, our research aimed to explore how PoL could better monetize customers both at and post-transaction through targeted content—such as emails, social media, and ads—that promotes upsells of printed products related to their purchases or events. This initiative encouraged us to think expansively about additional items customers might desire for their events (e.g., monogrammed napkins, glassware, wedding signage, or keepsakes like hang-on-wall materials). These upsell opportunities could involve either expanding PoL’s existing product offerings or introducing entirely new ones.</p>
            <p>To drive both new/more customers and more products, we adopted a data offense approach. By leveraging data insights, we targeted new customer sales while simultaneously encouraging existing customers to purchase additional products—thereby aligning our growth strategy with both market demand and ROI objectives.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Problem Identified:</h2>
            <p>First the team needed to conduct customer research to determine who precisely has a “hair on fire” problem and in what context understanding their pain points on that journey. That will determine whether there is an opportunity to test into. To achieve this, we conducted a series of weekly user interviews, leveraging both carefully designed screeners and our personal networks. Over two iterative rounds of initial customer research—and two rounds of testing the proposed product—we engaged with over 60 users in total. During our weekly huddles, recurring issues emerged, allowing us to refine our interview guides to focus on uncovering a single “hair on fire problem.”</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p>“Newlyweds-to-be” are reluctant to request RSVPs and gather addresses, fearing they might annoy their guests. This hesitation drives a bounce rate of XX% and a lower completion rate for guest management features, indicating couples are disengaging from tools meant to streamline their wedding planning process.</p>
            <p>Our “newlywed-to-be” persona encompasses all couples in the post-engagement phase of their wedding planning—diverse in partnership type yet united by a shared desire for a seamless planning experience. By this point, they’ve typically settled on major decisions like wedding theme and style, and they’ve already engaged with PoL’s wedding invite services. Their priority now is to manage the final details—particularly guest communication and logistics—without feeling like they’re nagging friends and family. They’re looking for intuitive solutions that streamline RSVP collection, address management, and event updates, all while preserving positive relationships with guests. Their ultimate goal is a stress-free lead-up to the big day, relying on products and services that minimize friction and maximize clarity.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Defining Success:</h2>
            <p>A successful solution would alleviate user hesitation, increasing RSVP tool adoption, reducing bounce rates, and driving engagement with PoL’s wedding planning features.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p>The team proposed an “Address Collection” digital tool to integrate with the Prints of Love website. This tool would automate follow-ups and address management, reducing manual efforts for users.</p>
