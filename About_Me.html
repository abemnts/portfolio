        <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
        <div class="journey-content">
            <div class="journey-text">
                <p>Originally trained in chemical engineering and materials science, I took the leap into product management—and I’ve never looked back!</h2>
                <p>With 5+ years of experience, I’ve built and managed SaaS platforms, internal data products, and web applications across B2B2C and B2B business models. My expertise spans UX research, user acceptance testing (UAT), data-driven experimentation, strategic roadmap planning, and product-led growth, enabling me to engage effectively with stakeholders, cross-functional teams, and executive leadership.</p>
    
                <h3>Product Ownership</h2>
                <p>If you’re looking for a reliable, impact-driven Product Manager to navigate the software development lifecycle, you’ve come to the right place. With deep expertise in Agile methodologies and end-to-end product management, I ensure products evolve to meet user needs and deliver business impact.</p>
                <p>A product is never truly finished (as evidenced by the ever-growing backlog of this very portfolio site). Success comes from continuous iteration, deep customer empathy, and a relentless pursuit of progress. From ideation to launch and beyond, I own the entire product lifecycle—always striving to create exceptional user experiences while driving measurable business value.</p>
    
                <h3>Strategic Planning</h2>
                <p>I specialize in crafting and executing 1–3 year product roadmaps that drive growth and revenue. My approach is data-driven and user-centric, identifying high-impact problems and leveraging iterative development strategies to build adaptable, scalable products.</p>
                <p>Grounded in rapid prototyping and continuous user testing, I ensure that product decisions are informed by real-world user behavior. Combining hands-on experience with structured learning, I’m prepared to take on senior product management roles with confidence and agility.</p>
    
                <h3>Continued Learning</h2>
                <p>I thrive on continuous learning, having earned an MBA from NYU Stern, specializing in Technical Product Management and Management of Technology & Operations. I supplement this foundation with Agile certifications and self-driven projects—like this very portfolio site!</p>
                <p>As I look ahead to my next career move, I welcome new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities. Feel free to reach out!</p>
    
                <h3>Customer & Market Insights</h2>
                <p>I have hands-on experience in UX research, partnering with UX leads, consulting agencies, and conducting independent user interviews across academic and professional settings. By synthesizing qualitative insights with quantitative data, I capture the customer voice in prioritizing features that are customer-driven.</p>
    
                <h3>Experimentation</h2>
                <p>With a chemical engineering research background, I’ve honed skills in design of experiments, data analysis, and success metrics definition—all of which I apply to A/B testing, onboarding optimization, and user retention strategies.</p>
                <p>I believe in measured experimentation as a catalyst (always the ChemE at heart) for growth—turning data-driven hypotheses into actionable insights. By embedding iterative learning loops into product development, I drive feature adoption, engagement, and long-term success.</p>
